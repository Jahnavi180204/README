# PROJECT HUB

A project hub is a centralized platform or tool designed to facilitate project management 
and collaboration. It typically provides features such as task tracking, file sharing, team communication, and 
progress monitoring. Project hubs aim to streamline workflow, improve team coordination, and enhance overall 
productivity by offering a single location for all project-related activities and information. They can be 
customized to fit the specific needs and preferences of different teams or organization. 

Project Hub features include project management with boards and tasks, collaboration tools like issues and pull requests, integration with other services, documentation hosting, code review, and version control.
